# ETL Script for ERP Data Import

## Overview
This Python script serves as an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool for importing data from ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems into a MySQL database. The script is designed to handle JSON data files representing capacity ledger entries and item ledger entries.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **MySQL Database:**
   - MySQL server is running.
   - Configure the MySQL connection details in the script (`host`, `user`, `password`, `database`).

2. **JSON Data Files:**
   - Place the JSON data files (`Capacity_Ledger_Entries.json` and `Item_Ledger_Entries.json`) in the specified directory (`testing/` in this example).

3. **Python Libraries:**
   - Install the required Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install mysql-connector-python
     ```

## Usage

1. **Script Execution:**
   - Run the script by executing the Python file:
     ```bash
     python etl_script.py
     ```
2. **Database and Tables Creation:**
   - The script initializes a MySQL database (`labint`) if it doesn't exist.
   - Two tables (`capacity` and `item`) are created within the database.

3. **Data Loading:**
   - Data from JSON files is read and inserted into the corresponding database tables.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Customize the MySQL connection details and file paths in the script as needed.

## Database Tables

### 1. Capacity Table
   - Fields:
     - `id`: Primary key (auto-incremented)
     - Various fields for capacity ledger entries.

### 2. Item Table
   - Fields:
     - `id`: Primary key (auto-incremented)
     - Various fields for item ledger entries.

## JSON Data Files
   - Ensure that JSON data files (`Capacity_Ledger_Entries.json` and `Item_Ledger_Entries.json`) adhere to the expected format.

## Conclusion
This script facilitates the extraction, transformation, and loading of ERP data into a MySQL database, providing a structured approach for managing and analyzing data from your ERP system. Customize the script according to your specific ERP data structure and requirements.
